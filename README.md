## Project Overview
ReadSoil is a Flutter-based Android app that connects to a Bluetooth soil sensor device to retrieve temperature and moisture readings. It stores readings in Firebase Firestore and provides a clean, responsive UI for viewing current and historical data. Users without a Bluetooth device can toggle to view mock data for testing.

---

## Features

### Bluetooth Device Communication ðŸ“¡
- Scan and connect to a generic Bluetooth device emitting soil temperature (Â°C) and moisture (%) readings.
- Fetch the latest values from the connected sensor.
- Toggle between real sensor data and mock data if a Bluetooth device is unavailable.

### Firebase Integration ðŸ”¥
- Secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication with email/password login and signup.
- Readings are stored in a Firestore database with a timestamp, temperature, and moisture.

### App UI ðŸ“±
- A Home Screen provides a clear overview with buttons to "Test" (fetch a new reading) and "Reports" (view the latest reading).
- A History Screen displays past readings as a chronological list or a dynamic line chart.
- Fully responsive design with light and dark mode themes.

### Good to Have âœ…
- Graphical charts using `fl_chart` for real-time visualization of soil health trends.
- Real-time synchronization of data updates with Firebase Firestore.
- Offline caching of the last readings for display when the device is not connected to the internet.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/DhruvChaurasia9403/Soil.git>
cd readsoil
```

### Install Flutter Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Configure Firebase
- Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
- Enable Firestore and Firebase Authentication (email/password provider).
- Run `flutterfire configure` to generate `firebase_options.dart` file
- Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app/` directory.
- Ensure your Firestore security rules allow read/write access for authenticated users.

### Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

---

## Data Model

Soil readings are stored in Firestore using the following data model:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

class SoilReading {
  final DateTime timestamp;
  final double temperature;
  final double moisture;

  SoilReading({
    required this.timestamp,
    required this.temperature,
    required this.moisture,
  });

  factory SoilReading.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) {
    return SoilReading(
      timestamp: (map['timestamp'] as Timestamp).toDate(),
      temperature: map['temperature']?.toDouble() ?? 0.0,
      moisture: map['moisture']?.toDouble() ?? 0.0,
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toMap() {
    return {
      'timestamp': timestamp,
      'temperature': temperature,
      'moisture': moisture,
    };
  }
}
```

---

## Assumptions
- The Bluetooth sensor device is a generic BLE device that transmits mockable temperature and moisture data.
- The app supports toggling between real sensor data and mock data when the hardware is not available.
- Firebase Auth is used exclusively for email/password authentication.
- Offline caching is a "good to have" feature, with last-known readings stored locally for display.

---

## Dependencies
- `flutter_bloc` & `bloc`: State management.
- `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`: Firebase integrations.
- `flutter_blue_plus`: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.
- `fl_chart`: Interactive charts.
- `pdf` & `printing`: Optional PDF report generation.
- `flutter_animate`, `google_fonts`, `intl`, `iconsax`, `flutter_screenutil`: UI/UX enhancements.

---

## APK Build & Installation

### Build Command
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

### Minimum Android Version
